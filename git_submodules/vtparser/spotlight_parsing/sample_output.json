Currently, many medications have poor solubility and bioavailability, meaning that only a small portion of the drug reaches the bloodstream to combat illness.

Edgar’s students modify them through selective photosynthesis to create safe derivatives with attributes that enable them to help to move the drug from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream and to control release times. This opens the door to extended release medications that allow the patient to take a pill once a day, rather than once every few hours. Edgar said the opportunity to create extended release medications is an important one because that convenience is a vital component of successful treatment."

In May 1985, Klatt spent 24 hours running the track at the University of Puget Sound. As nearly 300 friends, family members, and patients looked on in support, Klatt completed 83 miles and raised $27,000 to benefit the American Cancer Society. Today, Relay For Life brings more than 3.5 million people together annually."

If we can understand the reasons, we may be able to predict what populations are more likely to be involved in epidemic transmission,” said Myles. “One day we may have a rapid test to use in the field to determine if a mosquito population has some degree of immunity that makes it less competent. It is difficult to control mosquito populations. If you knew which ones you had to control, it would be easier to sustain control tactics for longer periods of time.”"
